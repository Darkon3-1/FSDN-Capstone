## Motivations

This is the last project of the `Udacity-Full-Stack-Nanodegree` Course. For which I wanted to make sure my skills were up to date.

It covers following technical topics in 1 app:

1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy` (see `models.py`)

2. API to performance CRUD Operations on database with `Flask` (see `app.py`)

3. Automated testing with `Unittest` (see `test_app`)

4. Authorization & Role based Authentification with `Auth0` (see `auth.py`)

5. Deployment on `Heroku`

## Start Project locally
Clone repository into a local folder.
Reqs: Python 3

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize, activate a virtualenv, and install dependencies:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
With the project being locally, we can setup a sqllite database



3. Change database config so it can connect to your local postgres database
    - Open `models.py` with your editor of choice.
    - Make sure the following lines are setup correctly for local
```
 7 # If run locally, uncomment the following below
 8 database_filename = "database.db"
 9 project_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
10 database_path = "sqlite:///{}".format(os.path.join(project_dir, database_filename))
11
12 # For running on Prod
13 #database_path = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']
```
4. Setup an account with Auth0 for permissions

5. Start the server:

```
$ python app.py
```
